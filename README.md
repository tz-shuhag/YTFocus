![Logo](assests/img/icon.png)

A [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) filter list to hide all traces of YouTube distractions in Feed and videos.
This filter list might work with other content blockers, but I haven't looked into that (yet).

# STEPS
1. uBlock Origin
2. Open the Dashboard
3. Filter Lists
4. 'Import...'
5. Paste this link below
- **https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tz-shuhag/YTFocus/refs/heads/main/list.txt**
6. Click Apply Changes

## Hides element like
- Homepage feed
- Search Page post
- Create Button
- Microphone Button
- Video Recommendations
- Distracting elements in play screen
