# Youtube Focus

A [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) filter list to hide all traces of YouTube distractions in Feed and videos.

This filter list might work with other content blockers, but I haven't looked into that (yet).

Copy the link below, go to uBlock Origin > Dashboard > Filters and paste the link underneath the 'Import...' heading:
- [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tz-shuhag/YTFocus/refs/heads/main/list.txt]

## Hides element like
- Homepage feed
- Search Page post
- Create Button
- Microphone Button
- Video Recommendations
- Distracting elements in play screen
