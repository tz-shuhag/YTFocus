# Youtube Focus - Productive & Efficient
![Logo](assests/img/icon.png)

A [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) filter list to hide all traces of YouTube distractions in Feed and videos.
This filter list might work with other content blockers, but I haven't looked into that (yet).

# STEPS
1. uBlock Origin
2. Open the Dashboard
3. Filter Lists
4. 'Import...'
5. Paste this link below
- `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tz-shuhag/YTFocus/refs/heads/main/list.txt`
6. Click Apply Changes

## Hides element like
- Homepage - **Feed**
- Search Page - **Post**
- Buttons - **Create, Microphone**
- Player - **Sidebar, Like, Dislike**
